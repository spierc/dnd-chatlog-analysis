Vinz Clortho:

i'll paste it
You can place a Warlock's Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. A
cursed enemy is more vulnerable to your attacks. Ifyou hit a cursed enemy with an
attack, you deal extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra damage after
Vinz Clortho:
making the damage roll. You can deal this extra damage once per round, so if you have
dealt Warlock's Curse damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until
the start of your next turn.
:
A Warlock's Curse remains in effect until the endof the encounter or until the cursed
enemy is defeated.
:
You can place a Warlock's Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter;
Vinz Clortho:
each curse requires the use of a minor action. You can't place a Warlock's Curse on a
creature that is already affected by your or another character's Warlock's Curse.
sorry
Elliott:
woah there's too

Merkatroid Skittle:
Harrow!
Vinz Clortho:
hahaha
thats rough
JonnyBadger (GM):
sup guys.
Vinz Clortho:
have you downloaded mumble?
thats the mumble download link
JonnyBadger (GM):
nope ... I'll get on it now.
Vinz Clortho:
yups, we can hear ya
Merkatroid Skittle:
installing it is pretty easy
when you fire it up, it should have like a wizard that pops up (a non-magical kind), that lets you setup your mic.
then you just paste in the hostname to the mumble server, pick a username and thats pretty much it.
ya
Vinz Clortho:
yu[
yup
it doesn't matter
if we've all got headsets
Merkatroid Skittle:
my shit works here, but it echo's like mad, but for some reason works fine in mumble.
Vinz Clortho:
it shouldn't be an issue
Merkatroid Skittle:
whats that sorry?
oh
Vinz Clortho:
haha
Merkatroid Skittle:
yah all the installers say that :P
it doesn't do shit
lol
that will lose us :P
k
JonnyBadger (GM):
back
Merkatroid Skittle:
cool
eldritchblast.crabdance.com
thats the hostname that you'll pump in
when you start mumble
when / if you get it up and running you'll probably want to restart d20 and like unshare the mic from it, so we don't get double audio.
Jason:
some heavy breathing's always nice
once your done the setup wizard
you can go to like server -> connect
it uses cert based auth
basically just hit Yep
eldritchblast.crabdance.com
Jason:
just click Add New
and fire that in there
leave the port at whatever teh default is
eldritchblast.crabdance.com
thats the address
then you pick a username

How's things in France?
I think mitch is out for today
he's got dinner plans or something
JonnyBadger (GM):
good ... we went on a super long hike today.
Graeme and Jake are no shows to.
.... I think we'll post pone then.
How are you?
Jason:
not too bad
JonnyBadger (GM):
Livin with the big snow?
Jason:
well we had snow last week
its gone again and pretty much summer again.
JonnyBadger (GM):
???
Jason:
but it was a pretty massive blizzard
for halifax anyways
JonnyBadger (GM):
Wow.
Same here ... we were out in short sleves today.
Jason:
I've got a buddy thats going to be around in like 5 mins or so
if you can generate an invite link for me.
he's got a char rolled up. One of my dnd buddies from moncton.
JonnyBadger (GM):
How's everything else? How's work?\
Jason:
Works good, just got finished a week and a half vacation :)
JonnyBadger (GM):
nice.
That's cool that your buddy is keen to play .... but I think that I'll just call it ... sorry bud. I was hoping to have more of ya's ... and if it's just gon'na be two .... I think I'll turn in.
Jason:
oh ya I didn't mean to play for today
he just wants to get a look at the interface
JonnyBadger (GM):
Next time if your friend wants to game ... that would be just fine.
Oh great.
Jason:
and then I can show him how to make the macro's and shit.
JonnyBadger (GM):
nice
there is the invite.
Jason:
cool thanks
maybe I'll try to figure out the DM interface.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Man I do miss table top gaming with you guys .... you ever get out to Snickers' to game?
Jason:
so I can make a little game and have him get familiar.
haven't seen any of those guys in a while.
I've been in moncton quite a bit cause of vacation and whatnot.
JonnyBadger (GM):
The DM interface is not hard ... the trickiest thing so far was importing maps.
I keep getting the up dates on The nerd herd group on Facesbook .... I think Gunner is still a member. They get together every week or so ... but I don't think it's going real well.
Jason:
I saw snickers on steam this week
I assume he's got internets again?
maybe
JonnyBadger (GM):
I know Snickers put up a new "looking for gamers" ad on Gelatinous Dudes. Are you a member of GD? You could go see his ad.
He does at Joanne's.
Jason:
I was working though so I didn't have time to shoot the shit with him.
JonnyBadger (GM):
I don't think he does at home yet.
Jason:
I'll ping him next time I see him on there see what they've been upto.
Anyways I'll let you get back to doing whatever the French do :)
Have a good one man, take care.
JonnyBadger (GM):
I'm going to eat hot cheesy crab dip in bed.

In responce to Jake's question. You search the old wizards house. The place has really been stripped and trashed. Looks like who ever was here was searching for something to. Anything that even looks remotely valuable is gone. Most of the books that are left have been ripped apart. All the crockery smashed. some of the walls have holes knocked in them and some floor boards are ripped up. A real search job. You do manage to find a tattered old bath robe, one plush and soft now flattened and stiff with age. It is monogrammed with the initials

Still glowing from the vacation.
I saw so much and go so much insperation.
Jason:
vacation eh?
where'd you go to?
JonnyBadger (GM):
Ya we went on a bit of a tour.
Jason:
see any castles?
JonnyBadger (GM):
yes .... yes we did.
Jason:
score
there's one we saw.
and some others .... stay tuned to the blog.
I learned a lot.
Jason:
oh dang
that's pretty old school
JonnyBadger (GM):
no foolies.
Jason:
full on portcullis
JonnyBadger (GM):
there were hundreds of old chateaus .... we had to pick only a few to visit....
we are going back fo sho.
Jason:
yah, should always ask where they torture people.
be all like got any iron maidens?
or racks
JonnyBadger (GM):
Throw them in the Iron Maiden.
Excellent!
Jason:
there was a cool castle we went to see in montreal, but like not nearly as cool as that one.
JonnyBadger (GM):
I went down to the dungeons of one castle ... but it was prety lame ... just a small room with some smaller rooms off it.
Jason:
didn't have a moat or draw bridge or portcullis. it was more of a farm.
JonnyBadger (GM):
heh heh ... I'll bet you saw something cool there ... every chateau we go to has at least one cool thing I find.
Jason:
oh yah, it had like a sweet lookout tower.
just no torture devices :P
I guess I need to visit more spanish castles to see those, or any inquisition related castles.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Like how the old doors are set into a carved door frame ... like they all have a small step up and a rim all around the door ... that in the winter was lined with felt to keep out the drafts .... never would have thought of that.
We are planning a trip to spain.
cool\
Jason:
dang nice
oh thats crazy, but I guess heating a castle can't be easy.
JonnyBadger (GM):
and the door thing .... meand that now when running through a castle you have to watch out for the little lintel that is carved into the stone around every door .... lots of tripping hazards.
Jason:
were all the doors like midget sized on the inside?
most castles I've seen seemed to be for midgets
maybe not like full on midget but like made for short folks..
JonnyBadger (GM):
yes and no ... most doors I had to duck a bit ... a few I had to bend over to enter .... and one or two were so big I could have piggy backed myself through them ....
It all depended on what room you were going into.
Jason:
did it have a throne room?
JonnyBadger (GM):
They have rooms that are just joining rooms. Just a room with like 6 or 7 doors leading off it in wierd places. Just a room to go through to get to other rooms .... so cool.
Haven't seen any real "Thron rooms"
Throne
Jason:
How far away was the castle from where your livin?
JonnyBadger (GM):
but I did see something close ... a sweetsweet super high backed wooden chair ... very throne like.... and they told us they were made with the high strong backs to deter back stabbers...
Jason:
lol
fuck
JonnyBadger (GM):
the one in the blog was about a 5 hour drive.
we were staying in B&Bs all the way ... so much good food.
Jason:
thats pretty slick, learning lots of french?
JonnyBadger (GM):
ya ...Kim is learning more than me ... soon she will be the better French talkering person ... not like me the gooder at english.
Jason:
just point at things and grunt :)
JonnyBadger (GM):
that's the way.
Well it's looking like we might push tonight's game to tomorrow.
Jason:
I was just up by your old place, at the L&M getting some strap locks for my new guitar.
picked up a black gibson sg.
JonnyBadger (GM):
ooooooo
Jason:
so hopefully I won't smash it on the ground now.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Very rock and roll.
I was listning to some of the songs you gave me .... I think it was Buckethead ... some real dirty metal groves with no lyrics.
It was just right.
Jason:
yah thats probably buckethead
he's a beast
JonnyBadger (GM):
fat bass sound?
Jason:
they had one of his guitars at gig street
1800$ though
but it has 2 arcade buttons on it
JonnyBadger (GM):
damn
Jason:
they are kill switches
JonnyBadger (GM):
Oooooooo
Jason:
I like to think of it as when you press em people die, but it just mutes the volume :P
JonnyBadger (GM):
were they red and yellow?
Jason:
2 red buttons.
JonnyBadger (GM):
sweet
JonnyBadger (GM):
heh heh nice.
Jason:
but yah buckethead doesn't sing
he just plays guitar or bass
or slap guitar / bass
JonnyBadger (GM):
ya what I was listning to was big fat bass
Jason:
if there's singing its like some side project he would have done with like other folks.
he also wears a kfc bucket on his head, cause like when your a guitar god it doesn't really matter wtf you do.
like no other profession you could get away with that.
just like show up to work with a kfc bucket on your head.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Ahhh the dream.
Jason:
be like its my deal...
deal with it :P
JonnyBadger (GM):
You should try it with your work.
Jason:
the sad part is people probably wouldn't say anything
JonnyBadger (GM):
hehehe .... You just be like .... This is how I work at home all week.
Jason:
so for our chars backstory
did you want us to use the pdf you linked?
or is like the 50 questions fine?
combo of both?
JonnyBadger (GM):
The pdf I linked was for making up a back story if you can't think of one .... Central Casting is for a blank slate .... if you want to use it to get an idea and then fill in the 50 questions then super cool ..... or if you have an idea all ready then just the 50 questions will be great.
Jason:
ah k, I haven't had time to run through the pdf yet, but I want to take a peek at it.
but I had the 50 questions done from like when I first made the char.
so maybe I can use it to fill in some blanks.
I think mitch is in miramichi this weekend, so he's probably not going to be around today.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Ya he messaged me to say he was outt today .... I'll see if he can game tomorrow maybe.
I know Jake is working tomorrow ... but if you two are in and Graeme ... and maybe Snickers can join .... he Plays table top every Saturday but might be able to play Sundays.
We'll try again for tomorrow night.
Jason:
kewl what time tomorrow should I hop on?
I should be around all day
JonnyBadger (GM):
let's shoot for the same time ... 8:00 mine ... so .... um ..... 3:00 yours ... cool?
Jason:
sounds gud
I'll catch ya later then man, have a good one.
take care.
Get ahold of anyone else?
JonnyBadger (GM):
Maybe Graeme.
Jason:
tried to get mitch, but he's driving back to ftown now.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Ah.
Jason:
so he can't play whilst driving, the slacker.
JonnyBadger (GM):
nuts. How far off is he? Do you know?
Jason:
I think its an hour drive
he was just taking off like 10 mins ago though.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Crapper dapper. Oh well if Graeme is in we can do something just you to ... I have an idea for something quick.
Graeme is just in the shower aparntly .... glad he is cleaning up before the game.
Jason:
lol
good thing there's no smellovision for webcams
JonnyBadger (GM):
ya no foolies .... we just had a big ol' fish diner and this house is very low tide.
delicious though
Jason:
You close to the ocean?
JonnyBadger (GM):
Yep ... Le Conquet is the name of the town .... Google maps us if you are interested .... we live at 13 Rue Lieutenant Jourden
Jason:
oh nice thats pretty slick
JonnyBadger (GM):
Spirit of Bladehenge.
Jason:
that game had such a good soundtrack
JonnyBadger (GM):
Man I have been jonzing big time for some PS action ... and Brutal Legend would be a treat right now.
Jason:
you can get it for PC
I liked it so much I got it for ps3 and later for PC.
but I'm a dumbass like that buying games multiple times.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Not on my little PC ... and I don't want to clutter up Kim's work PC ... but it's a nice thought.
Jason:
just be like the metal made me do it.
JonnyBadger (GM):
NOt that dumb ... I'm thinkin I'm gon'na re buy Tomb Raider for the PS4 when I get one ... looks so good.
hehehehe
speaking of ....
Jason:
the ultra violent one?
JonnyBadger (GM):
So what we are gon'na do tonight because it's just gon'na be you and Graeme is .... Merkatroid is split up from the others on the way to Hugalot to go find Vahallah. You last heard he was playing a gig in this pig town at the Tawny Tusk ... a dive bar ... You gon'na go find him and bring him back to the game... er mission.
I snet Snickers a message ... maybe he'll join too. If we are lucky .... I'm waiting on a reply.
Jason:
kewl
so darksouls 2 just came out
been playing that
its pretty great.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Ya I saw Yatzee's review.
It looks great.
Jason:
you need basically to catch up on those when you get a system :)
JonnyBadger (GM):
I wish I had had more time/intrest to sink into the first one you lent me.
Jason:
you've got 3 great games + tomb raider waiting :P
JonnyBadger (GM):
heh heh
Jason:
the new one
is much more new player friendly
like there's more direction
JonnyBadger (GM):
I all ready played Tomb Raider ... just the up date looks super pretty
nice ... I do want to take another kick at that can.
Jason:
shits a bit more obvious, they tried to make it more "accessible"
so like maybe start with the new one
to get you hooked
JonnyBadger (GM):
That sounds both good and bad
Jason:
and then you'll eat up the first 2
JonnyBadger (GM):
right.
Jason:
yah well alot of what made it great was that you had no idea wtf you were doing.
but it also lost alot of folks, cause there was so little direction.
but it was done tastefully I found.
JonnyBadger (GM):
It was pretty open.
Oooo this is my favorite song.
Jason:
its still mega open, you can go wherever, the npcs actually kinda tell you what your goals are and whatnot.
JonnyBadger (GM):
nice
Jason:
which makes it better then "There's 2 bells, maybe you should ring em" as like the only text in the game.
JonnyBadger (GM):
heh heh
Jason:
Shit was pretty awesome last time
we got all excited about grogfest
didn't read the dates
show up early, shit was pretty funny.
JonnyBadger (GM):
it happens.
That was the point of giving you guys so many clues .... you can follow them in your own time.
Jason:
yah I just figured you had something elaborate planned, and we just go to grog fest :)
JonnyBadger (GM):
heh heh ... yep ... that happened to.
I have been listning to this great pod cast on the TOmb Show ... um .... called ..... Behind the GM scren.
Jason:
great part abour gm'ing 99% of your content never gets seen, unless by pure random luck.
who's on it?
JonnyBadger (GM):
and they work this system called the Lazy GM style .... it's about planning the broad strokes and catching the filler as you can.
I forget the names.
But the are good ... they have given me alot of ideas.
Jason:
its not like wil or the penny arcade folks.
ah k I'll have to check it out.
maybe I'll put off listening to black metal for like a day this week while working :P
JonnyBadger (GM):
heh heh ... might change your day.
NO it's not a game ... it's 3 GMs sitting around discussing their games and giving each other advice and tips and stuff.
I think it would be very helpfull and if Snickers is not going to join us in this game I might just try kind of the same thing with him.
Nice to bounce the ideas off someone and get feedback.
Graeme takes the long shower ..... maybe he is shaving his balls?
Maybe?
Jason:
I'd rather not think about that.
but ya
its always interesting to see how others would deal with a given situation.
outcomes are probably always quite different.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Here I'll send you some ball shaving pics to get your imagnation kickstarted. ...
Jason:
some may even involve wells and grells :)
JonnyBadger (GM):
HAHAHAHAHA
no foolies.
I have run the same quest multiple times with diffrent groups and am always amazed by the differences ... and more so by the things they do exactly the same.

Killer so Mitch is out getting his car.
Any questions or anything?
Elliott:
Graeme is coming too?
JonnyBadger (GM):
One thing I should havee said is that when you were asking around the Halfling twon if anybody had heard of Immanuel Schreier ... nobody had but if you said he was a metal worker or engraver they would have sudgested you ask at the guild of engravers ... and given you directions.
Graeme is coming as far as I know.
He said he might be a bit late.
I hope no too late.
but still no sine of Jay any way.
I watched the GOT bad lip reading ... pretty funy stuff.

Yeah, I thought it loaded automatically.
thats the download link for mumble
mumble is a seperate voice chat app.
JonnyBadger (GM):
you have to log in to Mitch's server to when you are up.
Merkatroid Skittle:
we are on eldritchblast.crabdance.com
for the mumble server information
when you first install mumble it should let you configure your mic / setup, and its a good idea to pick a push to talk key during the setup.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Dave Mumble is super easy to find amd install ... don't worry.
Dave S.:
Yeah I downloaded it a little while ago, I thought it was all set up after the laptop was restarted.
JonnyBadger (GM):
Sould be.
Merkatroid Skittle:
you'll need to use mumble to connect to eldritchblast.crabdance.com as the server.
Dave S.:
I'm just setting up the headset now.

you may have to press your push to talk key
if you set one up when you installed mumble.
Dave S.:
I'm a level 2 hybrid Tiefling, fighter invoker.
Valhalla Kazzam:
What's that funky thing where you don't need to add your con to your ac to get your HP< you add something else
Dave if you have push to talk on, make sure you go to settings and change your push to talk key
you have to set it
JonnyBadger (GM):
What Graeme?
Valhalla Kazzam:
Isnt there another way to get your HP other than adding your co to your AC
something funky for arcane types, I thought
Merkatroid Skittle:

I'm using a battle-axe, two handed.
Sorry I'm just trying to figure out how to set up my mic, I'm not the most tech-savvy person.
JonnyBadger (GM):
It can be tricky
Dave S.:
Oh yeah, I can hear everyone.
So I have the push-talk part selected, what's the next step?
Merkatroid Skittle:
you have to hold the button down while you talk
in the shortcuts menu
you should be able to add the button you want to use for push to talk

Jason:
hey dave
were on mumble
if you still have that installed.
Dante:
Ok cool. I thought I had it installed.
Jason:
yah you were on there with us last time as long as you haven't gone removing shit willy nilly it should still be there :)
Dante:
Yeah I thought I had it, but it looks like it needs to be reinstalled.
Dante:
I'm trying to figure out how to get my mic working.
Jason:
if you have mumble up
it has like a "wizard" that set's up your mic
its in the Configure menu -> Audio Wizard
that should guide you through the setup process.
GameMaster (GM):
How's it going Dave?
Dante:
I have mumble installed, and I haven't modified anything since the last time we gamed. I'm using Windows 8, so I'm all messed up and have a hard time navigating.
Jason:
if you haven't changed anything up
then you should just be able to hop on mumble
and it will have all your old settings
were on the eldritchblast.crabdance.com mumble server.
in win8 you should be able to search for mumble
GameMaster (GM):
Oh man to hear someone else explain it ... it sounds even better.

Vinz Clortho blows the rape whistle

Jason watchs vinz get raped
Dante:
Would it be a high enough pitch to send dogs running?
Vinz Clortho:
it's on the boarder between headache and dog-only sound
Dante:
Nice. Being a Tiefling, I think I'd hear it well enough.
Vinz Clortho:
it doesn't count if the raper hears it
Dante:
Bummer lol
Elliott:
yo
so how'd the last game go?
Vinz Clortho:
swell until i had to leave :(
although i'll be able to stay today!
Dante:
Pretty good. After I came in, Jay and I went hunting for rats in a sewer.
Elliott:
cool
for any particular reason?
Dante:
If I remember correctly, some rich guy had a rat infestation, so we went into the sewer and killed off a huge fucking rat (Jonny's description).
Vinz Clortho:
Jay explained that it was the size of a minivan
Dante:
Yeah it was huge. I almost died, but we ended up drowning it. Then skinned it.
Jay took its skin, I took its skull and eyes.
Elliott:
yikes awesome
hey ho
GameMaster (GM):
Couldn't find Kim's headphones

It was crazy. We walked through town, covered in blood and fur while dragging a dead rat carcass.

Jason:
some fail going down at work
GameMaster (GM):
lame
you got time to take a gamin' brake?
Jason:
I got to yell at foreign people in NY though
so its not all bad
oh ya
GameMaster (GM):
Oh my.
Jason:
shits going to fly tomorrow though.
GameMaster (GM):
I've never herd you yell.
Jason:
yah its not often
but it gets shit done
GameMaster (GM):
Not even at your unfair one shot kill.
Jason:
lol
well dnd's just a game, if he pulled that shit at work, it would be a different story :P
GameMaster (GM):
hehehe
So news buzz on the Facesbook is that Snickers and George are liking 5th ed ... and thinking about making the switch over.
Jason:
nice
I've read some good things about it
basically its more simplified
less calculating plus's
GameMaster (GM):
There is a lot of math in 4th ed.
Jason:
but there's a bit more room for abuse
like 3.5
its weird, they made changes that simplify but also some stuff that lets you do silly things.
GameMaster (GM):
Every system has it pros and cons
Jason:
so its like half good half whatever.
yep
I don't care which edition honestly we use, its more about the people playin.
GameMaster (GM):
Right on.
Jason:
don't get me wrong though I have like preferences for the rules, but not enough to make me not play certain ones.
GameMaster (GM):
Right. Anything about 4th you hate? Something we can mod maybe?
Jason:
not really with the way your playing
we can bend the moves to fit the cases for the most part.
while I like the playing card aspect of the moves and the at wills and stuff.
it feels more limiting
but we generally just talk it out and end up being able to shoehorn whatever moves into useful situational stuff.
GameMaster (GM):
Ya I get that and was actually thing about something along those lines this week.
Thinking about "called shots" and things of that sort.
Jason:
its like the accessibility issue, I'm willing to deal with it, cause we get more folks playing.
but for the folks that have been playing forever.
its a bit of a letdown lol
its like oh cool i can do less
but that's been going since each different edition.
GameMaster (GM):
RIght. I do try and let you guys do what ever you can think up.... or at least try and figure out a way to make it work.
4th is dumed down for sure.
Jason:
like you said no system's perfect, but it lets us have some fun together.
GameMaster (GM):
but as a GM you strive to never say NO YOU CAN'T
Jason:
so thats the main thing.
were at least not playing crazy 8's
GameMaster (GM):
Alll right ... tat good. please do know if there is something you want to do that is not covered in the rules .... just ask and we'll see.
Jason:
I think mitch is out
his gf's mothers birthday is today.
I don't think he got the mumble server working
so we'll probably have to use the built in chat here.
Dante:
I was wondering why I couldn't hear anyone.
Jason:
oh are you on his mumble server?
is it up?
I tried earlier but couldn't connect to it
GameMaster (GM):
Okay ... lame.
Dante:
I think I'm online.
GameMaster (GM):
YA the poopshoot one is active.
Jason:
ah cool brt
GameMaster (GM):
Crazy
Jason:
weird I can't connect to the mumble server.
GameMaster (GM):
poopshoot.crabdance.com.
????
Jason:
any chance you can open a command terminal
should be in like start -> applications -> accessories maybe
looks like a C:>
GameMaster (GM):
in muble?
Jason:
then just type ping poopshoot.crabdance.com
just in windows
it should look like a DOS terminal
GameMaster (GM):
Oh sure.
Jason:
and let me know the IP address that its coming up with.
GameMaster (GM):
never done that before .... where do I command terminal?
Jason:
for me its coming up as 142.166.231.182
when I ping poopshoot.crabdance.com
but I can't connect to it for whatever reason.
start menu
all programs
then accessories
Jason:
then it should be a black icon with a C:> on it
then it pops up a black window you can type shit in
then just type ping poopshoot.crabdance.com
in windows7 its called Command Window
might be the same thing in xp
GameMaster (GM):
yep I'm there
just typing in poopshoot.crabdance.com
Jason:
put the "ping"
in front of it
to ping it
GameMaster (GM):
Oh thanks.
Mine said it could not find host
Jason:
yah thats what I'm getting
lol
did it put any numbers
like 142.166.*
something
GameMaster (GM):
no just a please check the name and tryu again
Jason:
cool yah I can't connect for whatever reason.
GameMaster (GM):
if it's any help in Mumble the ping sais 125
port 64738
Did you ever creat a server for Mumble? We could use yours?
Jason:
I can set one up one sec
GameMaster (GM):
If it's too much of a hassle we can just use roll20
Jason:
its running
just getting you guys the address
GameMaster (GM):
killer
Jason:
76.11.17.54
thats the address
64738
should be the port
GameMaster (GM):
kk
Jason:
just fire those numbers in the hostname box
I'll setup a clever name for it at some point.
GameMaster (GM):
Are you M
?
Dante:
When I type in the address, it won't let me press "ok" to connect to the server.
GameMaster (GM):
did you put in the port to?
Jason:
you have to put like a label also, which you can put whatever the fuck you want, you could call it J's server or something.
just make sure all the boxes have stuff filled in
this is from the "server" menu, then connection -> add new ->
Dante:
It works.
GameMaster (GM):
or GURPS
no Birthright
Or Ravenloft
Jason:
is darksun still around?
GameMaster (GM):

Jason:

GameMaster (GM):
OH god

it was tricky
nice
hqhahah
DO IT!
It would be so hard to not write " then they all die"
every time
Jason:
lol
GameMaster (GM):
or to write "... and that's when he decided he was gay."
Jason:

GameMaster (GM):
Classy gay.
Jason:

Valhalla:
You find yourself floating at the edge of the sky. Around you only darkness, before you a galaxy of stars. The air is cool, but you sense a growing heat on your face. As the heat grows you become aware of a rushing, roaring sound. The sound is faint at first but quickly becomes a deafening din. Just at the point when you feel your ears can't take much more you begin to hear words in the roar ... or more accurately one word ... repeated over and over ... VAL-HAL-LA! .. VAL-HAL-LA! .. VAL-HAL-LA!. As the words become clear you eyes adjust to the dark and you see that it's not stars before you but the light of candles ... a sea of candles, being held by held of thousands of people. People from all walks of life:
Kings and beggars, priests and warriors, all races, classes, colors and walks of life all chanting .. VAL-HAL-LA! .. VAL-HAL-LA! .. You drink in their admiration. It washes over you in waves ... but some where in all this love is a touch of sadness. You look down, below your floating feet. There you see a beautiful silver and white coffin and lying across the coffin is THE GUITAR.
Vinz Clortho:
yikes

Vinz Clortho steps out of the store for a cigarette

Mitch actually steps out for a cigarette
GameMaster (GM):
The instrument speaks to you in your mind. It tells you that if you keep faking your love with all these old rich women then you will never find true love for your self. It shows you images of you coning old ladies out of their fortunes. Here you are dining in a rich restaurant while a pretty girl dines alone at home a slight frown in the corners of her perfect mouth. Here you are strolling through the park with a mark pointing out ducks in the pond while a lovely young ladies sits alone beneath a tree no one to share her dreams and wit with. Here you go riding in a fancy carriage pretending to laugh at her jokes while out side in the rain the wind whisks away her umbrella and her long sweet smelling hair starts to get wet. It shows you spending all your time wooing them, sweet talking them and then slipping away in the night with all you can carry. It shows you your self many years down the road sitting in a mansion surrounded by wealth unimaginable, when by chance she comes knocking, still lovely after all these years. Her knock strong but soft, confident and playful. She comes knocking at the door. You leap up to answer only to sink into the treasure. You open your mouth to shout to her but no sound comes out only a cascade of silver coins. Just then you notice lying in the heap a guitar and you know if you can just reach it and play a cord she will hear and not leave. She will hear and come in and pull you from this quicksand of gold and jewels. She will lift you up and you will lift her up and together you will soar .... if you can just reach the guitar ... it's .... just ..... out .... of .... your ......reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccccccccccchhh.

GameMaster (GM):
When you hold that guitar in your hands you feel the presents of destiny. You feel that this thing, this piece of wood and metal has great power. A power that you are unsure you could ever control. Rage builds inside you. A fire that burns your ears and spills from your mouth in a roar. You know there is no way you could master this intricate instrument. You will never play like the guitar players you have seen in concerts and on the street. Their fast nimble fingers plucking and strumming out beautiful melodies. It's like an Armageddon in your head. You just want to open your head and watch the world burn. You want to take that guitar and bend it to your will. Fuck those delicate melodies you can make this thing of wood and metal into a weapon ... a weapon that can topple mountains. You see yourself a raging god of fire and thunder standing astride the world shredding the very air with mighty slashing strums of this guitar. No ... you say ... I might not be able to master this guitar ... but I can use it to rule the world all the same. I will rule them with fear and rage and sorrow. I will shake them like an earth quake trembles the very stone ... I will rock them like a hurricane ... I will rule them with ROCK!
You feel nothing. You see nothing. The empty wasteland around you stretches off in all directions. All at once you are hungry and thirsty and lonely and scared. You turn around again and there ... sticking out of the sand is a guitar. You grab it. You put it on. You strum a cord .... and out of the hole in the ground where the guitar was stuck a fountain of wine erupts. Suddenly in a flurry of silk you are surrounded by beautiful women each baring a tray filled with exotic and wonderful smelling foods. Trays of gold and jewels. These lovely ladies fawn over you and bring you every desire you could possibly have.

We got the life, magic, and wealth rod
We're in a shitty contract with that Jericho/Arar guy to get all the rods. We're kinda hoping there'll be a way out of it.
we're hot on the trails of that thief Diamond touch and we found Braehme's apprentice, who's sorta travelling with us but he's useless.
Jason:
aka get 8 rods, profit :)
Elliott:
Yeah but he'l l probably use the rods to enslave humanity.
IO'm sorta hoping when we use them to bind the lich, the rods will like, vanish or something.
Jason:
voids the warranty's
Elliott:
anyways diamond touch has the time rod and lives in this dimension that we're in now. He kinda rules it so here comes another big caper.
oh and Vinz's parents were nazis and Brad Pitt's character in Inglorious Basterds is after us.

yah we had to get vinz's face tattoo's covered up cause of war crimes :P

Jason:

GameMaster (GM):
Sup dude.
Jason:
not too much
had a wisdom tooth pulled thursday
tryin to recover from that.
how's about you?
GameMaster (GM):
yikes ... that is not pleasnt.
Jason:
yeah I've had better weekends :P
GameMaster (GM):
I'm good .... tired .... the fall fatigue is hitting our whole fam pretty hard.
Jason:
you guys end up playin last weekend?
GameMaster (GM):
nope .... well .... yes ... only Dave showed up and we played for about an hour before calling it.
Jason:
ah right on
oh
I almost got in a fight
with the Guitarist from Tyr
in montreal
lol
Jason:
Mitch and I were out having a smoke during the headliners for the night, cause they were terrible.
and I heard some asshole bashing King diamond behind me while smoking.
he was making fun of his falsetto :P
so I jokingly just made fun of him
it was the roady for Tyr, with the guitarist from Tyr.
so we were talking to them about how bad the headliners were.
Jason:
and that we were leaving cause they were so terrible.
then the guitar guy was like, I was in that band before.
so then we started making fun of him something fierce.
GameMaster (GM):
hahahaha
Jason:
he wasn't impressed and we left lol
I told him he played well though :)
GameMaster (GM):
nice ... fuck him if he can't take a joke or an insult.
We went to see Yann Tiersen lastnight.
Jason:
yeah it was pretty funny, but oh my the last band was brutal, was like car commercial metal.
GameMaster (GM):
lame
Jason:
they had like 30 people on stage and you couldn't hear a damn thing
GameMaster (GM):
too bad
Jason:
I don't think they had a sound guy, or maybe they hit a critical mass of sound for mixing or something.
its like there's 2 guitar guys there and all you can hear is some asshole on a flute
oh yeah they had a flute guy
GameMaster (GM):
yikes.
Jason:
lol
and then like the lead singer busts out a flute and out flutes the flute guy
GameMaster (GM):
it would be hard to mix a 30 person set.
Jason:
he didn't seem impressed.
Elliott:
I do it fer a livin
Jason:
out flute people?
GameMaster (GM):
mix a 30 person metal band?
Elliott:
it's not easy o rworth it
mix shows with lots of people
the theatre I've done 25 or so at most
GameMaster (GM):
was it a stage band?
Jason:
I think there was probably more like 10 people
2 guitars, bass, drums, fiddle, flute guy, singer, some other singers and like some girl with like a crank based scandanavian instrument which I'll never understand wtf it was.
anyways they were terrible so we left lol.
Elliott:
stage band with like 4 guitars strings, horns, 3 drummers, 5 singers
GameMaster (GM):
Ah ... still. A band like that .... guys all trying to out play each other. Not a fun mix I'm sure.
A stage band at least trys to play together.
Jason:
the viking metal bands before them were great though.
GameMaster (GM):
still not easy I'm sayin'.
Jason:
and king diamond was damn awesome
GameMaster (GM):
nice
Jason:
such a sweet stage setup
they had a wroght iron fence at the front of the stage, and a couple staircases going up.
GameMaster (GM):
cool
Jason:
and of course some giant flaming inverted crosses and a floating pentagram.
GameMaster (GM):
of course.
GameMaster (GM):
sweet
Elliott:
cool
GameMaster (GM):
I sent you a pic of a sweet dice lamp Jay.
Jason:

GameMaster (GM):
I found it this week... the pic any way ... yes e-mail.
Jason:
oh damn
GameMaster (GM):
I's gon'na make one no foolies.
Jason:
thats like 100$ of dice in there lol
GameMaster (GM):
ya ... I was thinking of some kind of clear tube spacer down the middle ... so it would be less dice.
Elliott:
You can find em in bulk online sometimes
Jason:
yeah or your going to end up with like a subscription to wizdice or whatever the bulk sellers name is.
GameMaster (GM):
true ... chesez does pounds of dice on e-bauy
heh heh
Jode and I went in half and half on a pound of dice once.
Jason:
we saw secret chiefs 3 also in montreal.
GameMaster (GM):
There was some cool ones .... and a lot of crap.
Jason:
bunch of druid looking assholes playing crazy shit.
I think they are the old mr bungle band.
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh
Jason:
if you ever heard of em.
GameMaster (GM):
???
nope
they play shit ranging from carnival music to deathmetal.
I was pretty impressed they could do all that shit live though, they all had like 9999 instruments.
and sitars
the most important part though really is they where all wearing druid robes :P
Jason:
apperantly you missed em in france this year :P
they all had insane gear with microtonal frets and shit.
real wonky
must be fun to learn scales on that shit.
GameMaster (GM):
weird ... cool ... and weird.
Jason:
yeah they are great, put on a real nice show, no singing, so that was nice.
all instrumental.
GameMaster (GM):
nice to have a change of pace
Jason:
mitch should be around here shortly, I told him to turn on his mumble server.
and he said one sec.
GameMaster (GM):
killer
Elliott:
I'm just eating breakfast and trying to wake up
GameMaster (GM):
We will pick up 4 days after. So you guys have had 4 days to putter around Bridgetown learning your new moves and such.
no worries.
Elliott:
cool
Jason:
cool yeah I'm just updating all my macro's.
GameMaster (GM):
You have that shack to live in. but we'll say for food stuffs and other sundries ... clay pots to smash during your training montage. New gear ... and what not ... you each spend 15 GP.
Also if there is anything you want to do in these 4 days let me know. You will only have a bit of time because of the rest and training ... but you do have some time.
Elliott:
Are there any artisans in Bridgetown?
seamstresses ideally
GameMaster (GM):
Sure.
Elliott:
I wanna get that Valhalla Kazam image made into some merch tunics
Mitch:
harrow
sorry
mumbles is up
GameMaster (GM):
Thee is not really anyone here that does printing. One lady said she coulf embroider one for you ... but it will take 3 days and cost 5 GP.
Elliott:
no apologies necessary
GameMaster (GM):
hey Mitch
Elliott:
ok I'll wait to find a printer
GameMaster (GM):
how's it bud?
Mitch:
hi hi hi, still a bit sick
GameMaster (GM):
lame

Mitch:
dns updated
yah
Elliott:
oh hey I can't remember, did that bloodsteel dagger have a daily? Or just the bonuses
Mitch:
it was pretty fun though
GameMaster (GM):
The daily was the blood drain thing.
Elliott:
sorry I don't remember that
drain my blood for to activate the bonus or?
GameMaster (GM):
Oh ... sure ... my bad .... If you stab a Blodded person in the heart for the killing blow you can drain off some of their blood strength.
Jason:

Vinz Clortho:

Merkatroid Skittle:
we could be Rod Stewarts

GameMaster (GM):

Merkatroid Skittle:

GameMaster (GM):
Pun tastic.
Vinz Clortho:

or do we just dont know it yet
GameMaster (GM):

Vinz Clortho:

Elliott:
oh and are you cool with the rules about retraining feats?
it's called clever riposte
Vinz Clortho:
say that one more time
Merkatroid Skittle:
on a crit you teleport beside them and attack again.
Elliott:
I discarded trick strike in favor of easy target
Vinz Clortho:
slick
Elliott:
grants combat advantage even on miss
no sorry daily
I discarded the tricks trike daily and learned easy target daily
GameMaster (GM):
Ah ... sure.
Elliott:
if it's not cool it's fine it's just in the book you can retrain
Merkatroid Skittle:
I don't think its an issue, mitch retrained to tridents :P
Elliott:
haha yeah
Joey told me that he was in BC and some guy told him about it
Vinz Clortho:
also, there's no way i can use the trident as an implement right?
GameMaster (GM):
hahaha
Vinz Clortho:
kk
Elliott:
Hit:
"2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target is slowed and grants combat advantage to you (save ends both)."
Miss:
"Half damage, and the target grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn."

Merkatroid Skittle:
trident is versatile
so you can 1h or 2h
and you can also throw it
and its a ranged 3 weap
if you 2h you get +1 to hit / damage
Vinz Clortho:
ah ok
Merkatroid Skittle:
if you throw it its based on your str
Vinz Clortho:
even if i took melee training for chr?
cha*
Merkatroid Skittle:
yah for the throw
if you have the melee training, its just for the melee part, it like specifies str fro the throw for whatever reason.
Vinz Clortho:
cool
i'm not
i'll just be stabbin at people
cause it's dirty with just the melee basic attack
Merkatroid Skittle:
if you can flank, you'll get some nice +'s for combat advantage.
Vinz Clortho:
hahaha

trident and rod
sweet

Vinz Clortho:
warlocks curse damage bonus applies to any attack as well

Makin' any headway Janie?
We are just gon'a get started. Drop in when you are ready.
Janie:
what server?
Merkatroid:
76.11.17.54
Elliott:
faster than me
Merkatroid:
port 64738
Janie:
just saw that, sorry lol
Merkatroid:
just pop those numbers in the like 'hostname' area, same with the port, you can put whatever you want for the name.
then you can do the Audio Wizard, to setup your mic / speakers.
we generally use push to talk, so we don't get too much echo.
if you fiddle about in the settings you should be able to find that in there.
Janie:
yeah I already did all that :)
Merkatroid:
Elliot / Dante's god

Merkatroid:
I mined a sweet bloodstone football.

Merkatroid peeks the bloodstone football to Elliot
Merkatroid:
no we were busy freezing to death in the tundra, so we made a break to the treeline
I fought 3 bears while lord herpes layed on the ground the whole fight.
that got us some food enough to get to a small village.
Elliott:
I see
Merkatroid:
no were like out of the tundra at least
Elliott:

Merkatroid:
pretty near the treeline
I think
were still in the same vicinity just not freezing to death.
Elliott:

Mitch:

Merkatroid:
trying to find any kind of city with shops to restock

but for now we just went to get a sample / verify that its a sweet mining spot.
cause I had only heard rumours of it

For bloodstone?

from my dead cuzin dorf
yeah

Hatim:
I have to recompile my virtual computer's kernel every time I try to start it up. Anyone know why?
and by anyone, I kinda mean Jay haha
Merkatroid:
lol what?
that doesn't sound right
you shouldn't have to ever recompile it really.
Mitch:
hahaha
Elliott:
oh wow
Merkatroid:
unless you want to change something at the kernel level.
which since your probably not doing kernel dev, you shouldn't need to.
the only thing you should need to recompile is the vmware / virtualbox kernel mods if you installed the guest addons.
Hatim:
oh, maybe thats it? a lot of the time it won't let me run the vc until I execute '/etc/init/vrboxdev setup' in root
I might be missing a piece of that command, but its something like that
and sorry, didn't mean to offend anyone with my previous comment haha
Merkatroid:
yeah there's probably some wonky shit going on with the kernel module stuff
may not be auto loading them for whatever reason.
you can run modprobe to get a list / load modules
you may want to try that after a fresh boot to see if there's any of the mods loaded.
Hatim:
is modprobe installed with virutal box?
Merkatroid:
modprobe is like a standard linux util that comes with like the kernel
its the standard tool you'd use to load / unload modules.
Hatim:
ah, I see. okay, cool

I always start chatting to him as he's fighting bosses.

GameMaster (GM):
I dig around another time ... I think it's on one of my external drives.
not sure if you have to login to watch
but it seems you can watch from the webbrowser as well.
GameMaster (GM):
Apparently I can't prove I'm not a robot.
Merkatroid:

i'm robbbot on there, and mitch is mitchface.
he may have his stream set to friends only

if your ready to start though, i'll just type to him in all caps
get him to get on here.
GameMaster (GM):

METAL
Merkatroid:

Lord Herpes:
Groovy. I was thinking before you guys all head out to the show we can all chill for a bit.
Mitch:
and listen to more metal?
Lord Herpes:
Sure...if it helps...
GameMaster (GM):
.... I was just listning to some metal.
Lord Herpes:
If there's a band out there who can seamlessly blend metal and classical opera together, I'll give them a chance.
GameMaster (GM):
SoaD?
The do a good job.
Merkatroid:
Nightwish
had an opera singer
Lord Herpes:
Are they any good?
Mitch:
yah dave, you just described nightwish
GameMaster (GM):
nice
Lord Herpes:
Sounds like they might be singing about some LOTR theme.
GameMaster (GM):
I like the singer but don't care for the synth in this song.
Lord Herpes:
They strike me as the type of band who would sing about that sort of stuff.\
Merkatroid:
they prolly have some lotr stuff
but they aren't middle earth only
like something like blind guardian
Lord Herpes:
The singer is good.
But this is probably not even considered real music by Jay.
GameMaster (GM):
I think you gave me some Bling Guardian.
Merkatroid:
yeah probably i love those dudes
GameMaster (GM):
ha ha ... Blind
Merkatroid:
middle earth metals ftw
GameMaster (GM):
Bling Guardian , also a good band name.
Merkatroid:
probably more "rapper" names
Lord Herpes:
Oh lol I thought that if it wasn't raging death metal, walls of guitars, thundering drums and incomprehensible lyrics, it wouldn't be metal enough for Jay lol
Merkatroid:
I like pretty much any metal
GameMaster (GM):
The sound of a box of nuts and bolts falling down the stairs is Metal to his earss.
Lord Herpes:
lol Yup.
Merkatroid:
yeah thats basically like nine-inch nails :P
GameMaster (GM):
hahahaha
Lord Herpes:
I like the singer in Nightwish though, she has a good voice. Plus it's kinda hard to not look at her.
GameMaster (GM):
Dave you letch.
Merkatroid:
she's not the current singer
Lord Herpes:
Oh...
Merkatroid:
they've gotten 2 new one's since her
but she was the opera singer
so I linked that particular one
Lord Herpes:
Are they any good?
Merkatroid:
yeah they are like real popular
their new singer has a pretty sweet name
I think her names like FLoor or some shit
Lord Herpes:
Killer. I'm watching a video of them now, I guess the singer has some odd name like Tarja or something.
Merkatroid:
yeah that's the old one that got kicked out
Lord Herpes:
Why'd she get kicked out?
GameMaster (GM):
Too slutty.
Merkatroid:
the singers husband tried to like take over the band or some shit
and they just fired her.
Lord Herpes:
Crazy.
Lord Herpes:
No Mitch. Just no.

That was great.

I had to reinstall Mumble here, so I'll need someone to walk me through set-up.
Merkatroid:
once you do the first time wizard deal
it will configure your stuffs
then click the server -> connect menu
and put like new server
76.11.17.54
thats the address
Merkatroid:
and you can go set your push to talk key in the configure menu
settings
shortcuts
and then you can create a new binding there.
Lord Herpes:
What should I put for the label?
Merkatroid:
whatever you want
its a label
Lord Herpes:
Is it Mitch's server? I have the perfect name for it.
Merkatroid:
its mine
then when you connect, it should ask you for your username or whatever
so put a name without spaces in
Lord Herpes:
It said "server presented a certificate which failed verification. The specific errors with this certification are:
1. The host name did not match any of the valid hosts. 2. The certificate is self-signed, and not trusted. Do you wish to accept this certificate anyway?"
Merkatroid:
yeah
push whatever it is
button that lets you go past that
like YEP thats fine
or OK or whatever it is
i'm using a self signed certificate

is the reason your getting that message

Ahoy.
Were just waiting around for the other folks, were a bit early shooting the shit on mumble.
let me snag the info for ya.
76.11.17.54 is the server address.
64738 that's the port
and your Username, can be whatever you want as long as it doesn't have spaces in the name.
Crystal Lynn M.:
ok i will see if i can get on
thats the windows mumble download link.
if you don't already have it.
Assuming your running windows.
Crystal Lynn M.:
i got window tha tsays Mumber server connect
Merkatroid:
yeah you'll want to "add new"
basically my servers not a public server.
so it's not on the public lists, so you can just manually pop in the information.
Crystal Lynn M.:
is there a label?
Merkatroid:
label is just that, you can call it whatever you like.
its for OCD folks
that like putting labels on all the things.
once you have the ip / port and your username on there, you should be able to save the server info, and it should show up for you to connect to.
so you only have to set it up once.
Crystal Lynn M.:
it does but i get a certificate error
Merkatroid:
you can probably just like mash accept
or Yes, or whatever will let you skip that.
its because I'm using a self signed certificate
Crystal Lynn M.:
well i can hear you guys anyway
Merkatroid:
cool
that's the important part.
There's an Audio wizard in the "Configure" menu, that lets you setup your mic.
Crystal Lynn M.:
looking for it
Merkatroid:
you may also want to setup a push to talk key, so we don't get feedback.
Hatim:
are you guys talking on mumble?
GameMaster (GM):
yes
Jak:
Yep
GameMaster (GM):

Hatim:

Merkatroid:
yeah you get to adjust your mic levels in the wizard.
may be too close to the speakers if your getting feedback.
Jak:

GameMaster (GM):

Mitch:

GameMaster (GM):
Some times Mumble sends the audio out my speakers and I have to tell it to use the headphones.
Lord Herpes:
Quick, everyone talk major strategy on mumble.
Hatim:
okay, it's not working. I'm going to try some stuff, and I'll get back to you guys
you should probably start wiithout me while I figure this out, if you haven't already
GameMaster (GM):
Okay Seth ... I hope you get it. There is a mute button ... it's not something as silly as that is it?

Elliott impatiently plays with the acorn
Crystal Lynn M.:

Jak:
Does it say the target spends a healing surge, or does it say something else?
Crystal Lynn M.:
it says spend surges to heal others
Jak:
So you would spend your own surge
That would have worked.
Crystal Lynn M.:
oh ok well next time
Merkatroid:

Jak:
Is that an encounter, daily, or at will power?
Crystal Lynn M.:
lay on hands is at will
Jak:
Oh, more useful than my cure wounds.
Crystal Lynn M.:

Mine's a daily power
But it doesn't use any healing surges.

"The path to hell is paved with good adventurers who go looking in creepy weird towers"
Lord Herpes:
Shouldn't we be resting up? Vinz is still pretty banged up and some of us need to replenish our encounters/dailies.
Elliott:
Vinz can heal on the road. He's had worse than losing his head
Jak:
When ever we resume walking, I would like to discuss religion with our new Paladin friend. Also, I will carry Vinz so he can get some kind of rest.
Vinz Clortho:

I put the hat on Jak's head
Jak:
Don't you dare.
I will take those surges back.

One creature in burst
Effect:
You mark a target, which remains marked until you mark another target or if you fail to engage the creature. New marks supersede this one.
While marked, the creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you. Also, it takes +5 radiant damage the first time it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target before the start of your next turn.
Arwen :
On your turn, you must engage the target or challenge a different target. To engage, you must either attack it or end your turn adjacent to it. If not, the marked condition ends and you can't use it on your next turn.
Special:
This doesn't rely on intelligence or language comprehension of the target.
Effect:
The target makes a saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Effect:
Apply +2 as extra damage to your next attack this turn.

thats the last one I think
you should be caught up

I heard they're making a new Star Trek series for the CBS all-access streaming site in the US.

i heard that six months ago lol

yeah it's shooting in toronto
I'm hoping to get a few calls for it

Me too lol just wanted to break the silence.

hopefully its just as bad as deep space 9

That would be cool. I'm interested to see what time period they have it set in.

DS9 was wonderful, and I will fight you over that.

i loved ds9

no show should make you watch like 7 seasons of garabge for a good episode

and was like WTF

so was voyager
Elliott:
I've never seen an episode of ds9, enterprise or voyager
Jak:
I keep meaning to watch the rest of Enterprise
Lord Herpes:
TNG was good, but it's meant for people who have ADD and can't sit through an over-arcing story.
Jak:
But DS9 was definatly a different Trek.
Merkatroid:
DS9 was waiting 6 seasons for something to happen with the wormhole
Jak:
"DS9 has more shades of grey" as Sisko would say.
Merkatroid:
then they were like um ... I guess "something" can happen.
like the video game equiv of snipers
just camping
a wormhole
waiting for something to come out
Arwen :
no hit it with a tacheon pulse
Jak:
More like a Bastion turret with them fancy rotating torpedo launchers they had.
Elliott:
ah so the focus is on like.... the characters instead of things happening?
Lord Herpes:
Perhaps, but unlike TNG, DS9 had a direction that it wanted to go in. TNG was just like "let's cover our eyes, point at 2 different things and make an episode about it"
Jak:
Yep.
Merkatroid:
that would be if the chars were interesting in the least... like best char is a ferengi.
Arwen :
best char is Dax
Jak:
Naw, Sisko. He punched Q. Q never came back.
Lord Herpes:
I think it all comes down to personal preference. I can see that we're definitely not going to accomplish more than to agree to disagree lol
Arwen :
Q was awesome
Lord Herpes:
Yeah him punching Q was pretty awesome.
Arwen :
he always deserves it
Merkatroid:
dave should call johnny see whats shakin
I dun't have his numba
Jak:
"But Picard never punched me!"
Lord Herpes:
That's true. I think Q got bored of Sisko and never wanted to come back.
I don't have his number either.
Arwen :
he was busy hitting on kathryn
Jak:
He was.
Elliott:
Why would Q be able to be punched?
He's like, in control of reality
Jak:
Just to see if someone will punch him.
Elliott:
seriously?
Arwen :
he was an odd ball
Elliott:
I guess....
Jak:
Best guess I ever had.
Elliott:
well it's just... he was kind of like satan right? He just wanted to test the limits of the enterprise and make them compromise on their morals or at least think about it and expand their limits of thinking and reasoning.
Jak:
More like a chotic neutral god.
Elliott:
it just seems kind of lazy and self indulgent to write an episode where you punch god in the face for fucking with you
Arwen :
starting to think this game is off
Lord Herpes:
I kinda think that Q really pulled his punches and gave Sisko the chance to punch him, and was then surprised when he actually swung.
Jak:
On the other hand, I am now curious to see Borg in D&D.
Arwen :
we could assimilate them
Elliott:
a kind of plant based borg? zombie deals?
Jak:
Naw. Borg Borg.
Elliott:
have we tried calling him? I messaged him on the faces book
Jak:
No phasers, trying to gather material to make a communicator to contact the collective.
Small groupe of 20, enough that a hit of something will take down one or two before they adapt.
Slowly assimilating to get more resources.
Lord Herpes:
I think there's an actual Star Trek RPG. I had the books in PDF format a couple years ago, not sure if I still have them. I think the company that produced it is Decipher.
Elliott:
so just tech levels crazy beyond ours?
Jak:
Yeah, but no resources to utilize anywhere near it's full potential.
Elliott:
gotcha
is Jon's # still 902 495 0361?
Lord Herpes:
I have no idea.
Arwen :
not sure i have it in an email somewhere
Elliott:
no biggie
Arwen :
its 454-8086
Elliott:
well we could run the tomb of horrors
Jak:
Is that the one where I died after falling down then got better?
Merkatroid:
I've just done dishes
this is what happens
when I don't dnd
Elliott:
haha no that was just a trap dungeon I made. The tomb of horros is way deadlier than that one
Arwen :

does it have to be in the silewood or could it just be near the silewood

Has to be in capital

That would be much appreciated. We should also send something along to compensate for the bother. Is there anything that your family would normally purchase from out side the Silewood? Maybe spices?
As I do wish to make it worth theire time.

I'm sure one of the servents would be happy to do it...he'd appreicate a small tip I bet

Half.
Arwen :
lol
i missed a few sessions last time i played I think we were together
Jak:
I changed from being arrested by Kingfisher thugs to swinging it to being taken by the local guard.
Arwen :
good move
Jak:
Yes. Less beatings.
Arwen :
daaaaaaamn
Jak:
brb
Valhalla Kazzam:
Is this a flashback?
When did this happen?
GameMaster (GM):
Days ago. Yes this is a flash back.
Valhalla Kazzam:
Why are we banished? because of Herpes?
GameMaster (GM):
yes
beacuse of Herpes.
Jak:
back
Merkatroid:
we could go rescue mission herpes
they have him captured
or at least maybe get some of his dna for a rez scroll :P
Elliott:
in the highest room of the tallest tower
Merkatroid:
cause I'm sure they prolly splattered him
Elliott:
held by a powerful spell
Arwen :
he is in jail
Elliott:
that can only be broken by true love's first kiss
Arwen :
hes not dead
Elliott:
so....
no tit
not it*
Valhalla Kazzam:
(2 hours for the boots)
Elliott:
ok so Valhalla, you break in, kidnap the son and torture him for information.
Arwen :
holding a grudge eh lol
Valhalla Kazzam:
?
Elliott:
lol just wanna keep our npc policies consistent
Valhalla Kazzam:
oh I just got it
Arwen :
lol
no one told arwen about the no kidnapping policy
Valhalla Kazzam:
rolling 1d20 + 5

Elliott:
ok from now on, no kidnapping people unless we know it's the only way to get something we need.
Valhalla Kazzam:
I never agreed to that
Arwen :
yeah arwen shouldnt be in charge lol
it really seemed like a good idea at the time and to be fair the torture was very light
Elliott:
right. It's just another instance where we're not suuuper welcome in this city and we're already causing too much trouble then we do something violent to someone and it causes problems for us
Arwen :
its midevil times...that shit is common
we will fix it by taking that douch down
Elliott:
easier said than done and we've already got a massive assassination plot to deal with.
like, how much easier would gathering those cards have been in the silewood if herpes hadn't attacked that guard?
Arwen :
that is true...but i was just trying to get info to stop the assisnation
Jak:
Headphones on mumble
Mine is muted.
GameMaster (GM):
Did you figure it out?
Jak:
The "deafen Yourself" headphones mutes everything I mean.
GameMaster (GM):
Crystal?
Valhalla Kazzam:
hit mute and deafen
Arwen :
i can't hear anyting
GameMaster (GM):
Killer.. Thanks gguys.
Arwen :
brb
Elliott:
right and from herpes' perspective, he was trying to get us into that place to get those cards.
I'm not trying to drag that business up again, I'm just saying it was an impulsive decision with big big consequences that you maybe didn't consider. Like, grabbing a mafia boss... unless you kill him and there's no witnesses to the kidnapping or the murder then he's likely to retaliate unless you intimidate him so hard that he's too scared to.
just because he's evil, doesn't mean we can do whatever we want to him.
Jak:
Jak totally should have beheaded him.
Arwen :
i was definetly ims pulsive...it was my first time not having you there to come up with a plan...i went full on paladin style in your absense
Elliott:
and I understand the impulse
Arwen :
that is some impressive miss spelling on my end
Jak:
This is why Jak voted for Elliott to lead.
Or instincts are terribad.
Elliott:
I'm just saying we should always be thinking about the rammifications for our actions
Arwen :
the torture wasn't a plan I thought we could use the harp to get him to talk but we kept rolling freenzie
Elliott:
even that though, he'd remember that.
crossing a mafia boss is the first act of the crime movie where the hero is in trouble lol
and I've been burned by not thinking too. Jonny pays attention and always makes us pay for our not-thinking
Arwen :
lol didn't know who he was at all...i was told i had the power to arrest so I jus twent for it
Elliott:
lol did jonny tell you you have the power to arrest people?
Arwen :
yes
Elliott:
hahah
Jak:
Rookie mistake.
Elliott:
yeah he means like, you believe you have the power to arrest people
and your god says you do
Arwen :
oh that is not how i understood that
Jak:
You gatta spend some time eating doughnuts before you make your first arrest.
Elliott:
haha yeah
Arwen :
i though i really did
Elliott:
well, you do
right? like...
from your perspective you do
and if you were in a place where Athena was the ruling deity and the place was a theocracy... the local law would side with oyu
but Athena isn't recognized everywhere.
and just grabbing random citizens without grounds for arrest is what fascist police forces do
Elliott:
not calling you a fascist or evil but that's how it's likely to be perceived by the common folk
Arwen :
alirght arwen will try to be more diplomatic in future
Jak:
This is also medevil times. They don't know what facist, communist, or socialist means.
Elliott:
elliot will appreciate that
Arwen :
trying to save a teammates brother here lol
Elliott:
BUT
if you, crystal, want arwen to be like.... judge dredd or serpico then feel free to be impulsive
it's just that judge dredd and serpico are difficult team mates to have
Arwen :
right
Elliott:
lol yeah jonny always does that
any time I'm considering being safe in a dungeon, he's like. "nah you know you've got this. Go ahead and jump"
Arwen :
there was a lot of egging on
Elliott:
"try and sneak by the dragon. You're sneaky. You can do it."
"you're a level five you can TOOOTALLY beat that frost troll in a fist fight:
Arwen :
but i mostly stand by it...can't learn unless you mess up a bit
Elliott:
oh absolutely
and I've been burned by it more than a few times.
we'll get better
and we'll get there together
Arwen :
great....from now on arwen only makes justified kidnappings lol ;)
Elliott:
lol
Arwen :
im worried about this valhalla king fisher meeting he's still pretty pissed at arwen
Jak:
And he's not a big fan of Jak.
Arwen :
lol yip we def rubbed him the wrong way
Elliott:
Valhalla definitely has no love for arwen or jak.
But I don't think he'd do anything that would endanger us.
that said, I trust kingfisher as far as I could throw the moon
Arwen :
yeah he gives me the hebejebeies
Elliott:
and the fact that he's dealing with the barakts is bad juju
Arwen :
maybe we can take down that family here
we can kidnap all of htem
a family kidnappping
only this time heavy on the torture
Elliott:
haha
hmmm
what if barakt is here for those stones?
Arwen :
do we still have thme?
Elliott:
we have whatever ones you and hatim and jak kept from the bag
Arwen :
other ppl keep stones from the bag too
dammmn i thought that was just me
Elliott:
I don't know
I just know we went, not knowing we didn't have them all
Jak:
Jak had none.
Arwen :
but he knew?
Jak:
He had someone count them.
Elliott:
we didn't know that the bag was missing stones
GameMaster (GM):
You can all come back now.
Elliott:
we went in hopes to smooth all that over
Valhalla Kazzam:
thanks guys
Elliott:
and it went bad
Valhalla Kazzam:
all done
GameMaster (GM):
Thanks for your patience.
Valhalla Kazzam:

GameMaster (GM):

Valhalla Kazzam:
no, its agreed that he's letting us go if we give them up
Arwen :
you said he wants proof of our deaths by jaks horns and my symbol
Valhalla Kazzam:
yeah, if you personally give him th4e symbol and the horns
Jak:
brb, but if you want Jak's horns while I'm gone, he will not fight it. Horns occasionally get broken, or trimmed.
GameMaster (GM):
IT hurts though.
Jak:
Oh yeah.
GameMaster (GM):
I looked it up to ...winky face.
Arwen :
he wanst me to deliever so he can kill me
he is not the forgiving type
GameMaster (GM):
Having your horns compleatly cut off... down to the skull though ... is emasculating. Other Minotaur will see it as a sign of weakness.
They will also show signs of once being cut.... this stigma will folow Jak for the rest of his life.
Merkatroid:
is merkatroid here
at this conversation?
GameMaster (GM):
no they stepped aside.
Merkatroid:
ah k
GameMaster (GM):
you can have followed them if you like .... make a stelth check.

You mark a target, which remains marked until you mark another target or if you fail to engage the creature. New marks supersede this one.

On your turn, you must engage the target or challenge a different target. To engage, you must either attack it or end your turn adjacent to it. If not, the marked condition ends and you can't use it on your next turn.

GameMaster (GM):
Hey Jake.
Acutus:
howdie
GameMaster (GM):
Hey. Hows tricks?
Acutus:
not too bad
you on mumble i can't connect
GameMaster (GM):
Nope ... not till Jay or Mitch show up.
Acutus:
how come one of them has to be present
GameMaster (GM):
Because they need to turn on the server.
Acutus:
why can't one of us do that?
GameMaster (GM):
Because I don't have a server set up.... and I don't know how. If you think you could and would be interested then right on.
Otherwise ..... we wait.
Acutus:
lol...looks like it costs money so I guess not
whats new
GameMaster (GM):
I can't get that friggin' computer to boot from that disc.
I'm anout ready to blow it up.
Acutus:
lol your having a rough go with that thing
GameMaster (GM):
yes ... yes I am.
.... but every frustration afternoon I have leads to another lead..... so I'm a calm down and try that next. It was really boggling me that I couldn't just format and reinstal from the disk you lent me.
Acutus:
yeah not sure why you couldn't
GameMaster (GM):
Every time I come out of the back room all worked up Kim just says ... "Throw it out."
yep ... it's a real frigger.
Acutus:
I guess you'll have to give up eventually perhaps it is beyond saving
GameMaster (GM):
Probably. Just pisses me off. It worked .... it was slow but it worked and in my attempts to "fix" it I wrecked it .... I HATE when that happens.
Acutus:
haha yeah that's no good.
I'm starving waiting on a donair
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh
It's good to laugh about it.
FUCK!!!
heh heh
Tracey Jordan:
Your computer is no workin?
is it that old mac?
GameMaster (GM):
We stepped outside today to go to the store and I said "Holy shit." and Juliette kept saying it all day.
No it's a super old Windows XP laptop of mom and dad's.
Owen Growscarrot:
hahaha
Acutus:
lol thats awesome i love when kids curse
GameMaster (GM):
I took it to the shop and the guy said it's not worth his time and my money to fix it.
Owen Growscarrot:
does it boot into safe mode or anything?
GameMaster (GM):
yeah it starts up and works just great ... only no sound or wirless.
Owen Growscarrot:
dinger
does it connect if you plug it into ethernet?
GameMaster (GM):
I got a program that says it needs some drivers ... only I can't find them or make them work.
oh yea ... plugged in the inter net works great.
Owen Growscarrot:
well I mean. It could just be the sound and wireless cards?
Acutus:
you could get a usb wifi stick
GameMaster (GM):
yep .... oh you mean the cards are bunk?
It worked well just slow ... everything funtioned ... so I borrowed it with the intention of formatting it and restoring it to new .... only after the format I guess the sound and wirless drivers were not found.
Acutus:
one of my laptops the wireless card stopped working
GameMaster (GM):
Could be.
I wonder if the sound card from one of the old cheep laptops would fit?
Owen Growscarrot:
yeah like, old machines sometimes their cards just fail unfortunately
could be
there'll be at least 4 people on forums trying to do exactly what you're doing I'm sure.
GameMaster (GM):
Yep ... and I have been reading every single one.
Acutus:
who is owen?
GameMaster (GM):
I'm up to 24 hrs of time spent trying to fix this thing.
Jake.
Acutus:
cool cool
GameMaster (GM):
I have a new line to follow next kick at the can ... it's just time I would rather be doing anything else ..... trimming my ass hair comes to mind.
Acutus:
lol well who doesn't love that
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh
with dull sissiors.
Acutus:
lol
Owen Growscarrot:
If you ever fully shave it, use powder. Ass hair is like eyebrows. Super necessary
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh ... thanks ... gross
Acutus:
so how long we gonna wait?
GameMaster (GM):
a full shave down there sounds like more work ... and gymnastics than I'm interested in.
Are you not enjoying the conversation?
Owen Growscarrot:
I'm not flexible enough to even think about it
Acutus:
you can pay ppl to do that
GameMaster (GM):
Really? Is that one of the jobs at the temp agency?
Owen Growscarrot:
if I don't trust a barber with a straight razor on my face why would I trust someone down... there...?
Acutus:
lol theres always waxing
GameMaster (GM):
ow ow ow
Acutus:
yeah its not pleasent
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh Oh Crystal.
Do you mean getting waxed ... or doing the waxing?
Acutus:

GameMaster (GM):

Acutus:

right on ... sounds like fun.
Cant do it Saturday ... but Snuday I'm free for a bit so long as we stay in touch with Kim.
Tobrias Frunke:
I said if anyone would know anything about that type of stuff or kung fu fighting it would be you.
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh I do love me some Kung fu.
Into the Badlands is on the Flix now.
Tobrias Frunke:
how is it?
I saw it there
GameMaster (GM):
I got Kim watching it... she doesn't hate it.
Tobrias Frunke:
but haven't watched it yet
oh nice
Owen Growscarrot:
yo
Tobrias Frunke:
some dude at work gave me some punisher comics to read
GameMaster (GM):
I dig it.
It's not great dialog wise .... but the setting is cool and the fighting is good.
Tobrias Frunke:
they were pretty good writing, garth ennis did em
GameMaster (GM):
tits.
Tobrias Frunke:
same dude that wrote some of preacher
read like 12 of em last night lol
GameMaster (GM):
Truth be told I have only read some of the War Journal stuff ... but that was when I was ... 15?
I think ... so a while ago.
Tobrias Frunke:
it wasn't bad
GameMaster (GM):
right on.
Tobrias Frunke:
he like gunned down like 40 mob dudes at like a 100 year olds birthday party
and then went to the funeral
to kill the rest lol
GameMaster (GM):
he did have a wierd morality about him.
Oh I forgot ... I have Punisher meets Archie.
Great cross over.
Tobrias Frunke:
lol nice
yeah they mentioned that at work
there's a show on netflix now
riverdale
and we were theorycrafting
that punisher was now cannon
Tobrias Frunke:
to archie
GameMaster (GM):
I tried it ... it was not for me.
Tobrias Frunke:
yeah I haven't watched it
but I would if punisher would show up
I hear he's basically all of the season 2 of daredevil though
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh yeah no foolies.
Tobrias Frunke:
but haven't watched that either
GameMaster (GM):
Yea ... also havn't made it through season 1 of that show.
same for Jessica Jones and Luke Cage.
Tried Iron Fist ... but I think I've got Marvle fatigue.
These shows are not great.
Tobrias Frunke:
yeah
people at work going nuts for "LOGAN"
but I've had marvel fatigue
since like
they tried to remake spiderman 30 times
shits so bad
GameMaster (GM):
hehehehe
tru dat
Tobrias Frunke:
seen like avengers and some of the xmens
and like I like most of those chars
just can't take it seriously
with like live action comics
GameMaster (GM):
I get it.
Tobrias Frunke:
like deadpool was ok
people were gushing over it
cause like he swore
or something
and its like ... really
GameMaster (GM):
Unfortunatly I'm a keep at 'em cause I love so much the source material.
Eventually they are gon'na get one I like just the wat I like it.
Tobrias Frunke:
thats like what we've come to lol
GameMaster (GM):
fingers crossed
I liked that in Deadpool he wasn't saving the world from a blue sky lazer.
Owen Growscarrot:
Logan's not like a marvel movie
GameMaster (GM):
It looks like in Logan he is just saving one girl mutant? kinda a Last of Us feel ... at least that's what I get from the trailer.
Owen Growscarrot:
it was genuinely a good movie
GameMaster (GM):
no blue sky lazer?
Tobrias Frunke:
I hear he doesn't even wear spandex :P
Owen Growscarrot:
not anything
Tobrias Frunke:
lol
Owen Growscarrot:
no bullshit marvel tropes
GameMaster (GM):
interesting
Owen Growscarrot:
no laser, no love interest, no goofy sidekick
barely any banter and NO franchise malarky
I have zero criticisms
GameMaster (GM):
Hummmmm?
Owen Growscarrot:
seriously
It's raised the bar
Tobrias Frunke:
didn't they just make like a wolverine movie?
GameMaster (GM):
or 6
Owen Growscarrot:
that silver samurai one? Yeah it was fine
but logan was nothing like any of that
I don't think they even reference any of the other xmen movies
Tobrias Frunke:
food is here afk a sec
GameMaster (GM):
kk
well too bad it's going to be like a month and a half or so befre I can go to the cinima.
heh heh
cinema
Owen Growscarrot:
it's like they just said "let's ignore everything anyone else has done in terms of xmen movies and just make something that we want to see"
GameMaster (GM):
right on.
Owen Growscarrot:
not to set you up for disappointment jon but I fully predict you getting a bit misty eyed.
GameMaster (GM):
huh
Owen Growscarrot:
I don't wanna sell you on the action cuz it's not really heavy on that
there's good like, logan putting his claws in a dude but no spectacular fighting
GameMaster (GM):
well, I look forward to checking it out in a month or so.
That's cool. I loves me some fighting but it's not a necessity.
Owen Growscarrot:
I know I know. I've just heard a lot of people say like "the fighting was so good" because we finally see wolverine use his claws no foolies
GameMaster (GM):
Spent a good part of this afternoon fleshing out the Berakt family tree and business dealings.
I haven't heard anything about Logan.
This is the first conversation.
I'm a bit out of loops... I don't even know what's playing now.
I'm excited for season 2 of The Get Down.
Owen Growscarrot:
It's all over my fb feed.
Yeah that'll be cool
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh I guess hey know what you like.
Owen Growscarrot:
I'm rewatching the wire trying to get better at detective work haha
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh ... I guess I should watch Scarface then.
winky face
Owen Growscarrot:
ruh roh
the actor who played Omar in the Wire is up for Pacino's role in the Scarface reboot
I think it's because he's already got a scar on his face
GameMaster (GM):
I would watch that ..... but they should just call him something else. They could tell the same story and just change the names and I would like it better than a whole new story with the title SCARFACE plastered all over it.
I'm getting pretty fed up with movies thinking I'll only like them if I recognize them.
Fuck you it's FOREVER!!!!
Those 'member berries are delicious ... but I want a different flavor for a bit.
Owen Growscarrot:
ugh I know
"Ooh I member!"
GameMaster (GM):
Well fellahs I don't think anyone else is conin' out ... so I'm gon'na go. Juliette just stuck her head in to ask me if I would play with her ... so ... I think I will.
We'll do Episode 8 next week .... unless the baby comes.
Take care guys.

Daily ♦ Arcane, Shadow, Summoning
Minor Action Ranged 10
Effect:
You summon a shadow serpent in an unoccupied square within range. The creature is an ally to you and your allies.
The serpent lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in its description. You don’t need line of effect to the serpent to command it. When you command the serpent, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.
When the serpent makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.
The serpent lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.

GameMaster (GM):

GameMaster (GM):
Well nuts.
Are any of the servers up in your list Josh?
Jak:

Aldous Lovage:
Dunno. But you're editing my imp summon sheet
Arwen:
I'm so sorry...is there a cancel? I though I only had access to my characters
GameMaster (GM):

Amicus should have his own sheet.
Aldous Lovage:

Aldous Lovage:
Imp (Deathmist)

GameMaster (GM):

Arwen:

Jak:
And this will take to long for me to figure out tonight.
GameMaster (GM):
I don't see it.
You have one called Amicus.

sorry I'm late guys.
Ah I see that server we were using is not up.
Are any of the other Jay or Mitch servers up on Mumble?
Aldous Lovage:
one sec
no :/
GameMaster (GM):
I can run up and check my computer upstairs.
Shit.
Well lets try the roll20 interface.
Aldous Lovage:
We could skype too
Narada:
I find that Google Hangouts are really good as well.
GameMaster (GM):
do you both have Skype?
Aldous Lovage:
I does
Narada:
I think I do but I haven't used it in a couple years, so I have no real clue how to use it.
GameMaster (GM):
just do a search for Skype to see if you have it.
Narada:
I don't have it.
Aldous Lovage:
Is it just us two playing?
GameMaster (GM):
right. Let's try google hangouts then.
I've never used it .... so how it work?
Narada:
I think Crystal and Seth will each be late.
GameMaster (GM):
Crystal is coming and Seth maybe.
Narada:
For Google Hangouts, it's a browser based system. If we log into our Google accounts, one of us could set up a Hangout and invite the others.
Aldous Lovage:
I can get it, one sec
Narada:
As far as I know it doesn't have a push to talk set up, you'll need to manually mute and unmute your mic.

One idea I've been thinking about, which probably won't fly, is to set up a private community on Google+ for IX there. From there we don't need to worry about Jay and/or Mitch not having mumble up and running, and we can set up weekly game invites. It's also good for Crystal and Jay who aren't on Facebook.
I'm on Chrome.

The serpent lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in its description. You don’t need line of effect to the serpent to command it. When you command the serpent, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.
When the serpent makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.
The serpent lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.

if it can hurt you like that then we should take it
Jak:
type of large stick. It some sort or lightning magic built in.
Elliot:
ok so he's got magic weapons
Jak:
So when I was hit, it wasn't just a hit, i got electricuted as well.
Elliot:
and we're on his terf. A fight would be a bad idea here
Jak:
And he seemed very fond of it.
Like, it might be his favorite thing. After the switch.
Elliot:
and my guess is if he's got this kind of money he's well connected in the world. A lot of ripples if he was suddenly removed
they're a churchy family.
Jak:
He's at least a former well traveled adventurer.
Elliot:
maybe we could do a ... grand guesture?
Jak:
?
Elliot:
did you read frank miller's batman year one?
Jak:
Yes. But I'm in no shape to fight barehanded against an armed man.
Let alone three armed men.
Elliot:
he does this big intimidate move... He sets up a bunch of special effects. Smoke and lights and stuff and does a big intimidate check on the mafia don
Jak:
Oh, different scene. I was think of commissonr gordon.
Elliot:
being an adventurer it'd have to be a good effect but if we sold it right. Like HAELIN IS JUDGING YOU we might be able to scare him into not being an asshole
heh or maybe this is another Orc type challenge
Jak:
If we do this, and you want my help, I need a day to recover.
Elliot:
like we challenge him to a fight and if he wins he gets something. If we win he never touches his servants again.
Jak:
And I don't think we'd have the time? We should be going in the morning again.
Oh!
Elliot:
I dunno if we can leave these people in this state
if we take this kid, he's going to take it out on the others.
Jak:
If we do that as a form of entertainment tomorrow morning? as a gift before we leave?
Elliot:
and there's no way I'm leaving him here

By arranging small objects in your hand, you create an ephemeral structure made of magical force.
Phantom Bridge
Artificer 6
Daily ♦ Arcane, Conjuration
Standard Action  Ranged 20
Effect:
Choose a square within range and another square within range and within6(2 + your Intelligence modifier) squares of the chosen square. You create a phantasmal bridge between the two squares that lasts until the end of your next turn. The bridge connects the two chosen squares by the shortest path. The bridge has no height, and a creature can pass through a square containing the bridge as though it were normal terrain, even if it normally contains no terrain, difficult terrain, challenging terrain, or hindering terrain.
Sustain Minor:
The bridge persists
You bind the quickness of your enemy to the enchantments you placed on your ally, transferring speed from Jak to Elliot.

You summon a Small Necroplasm in an unoccupied space within range. The necroplasm has speed 5. If the necroplasm is reduced to 0 hit points, creatures adjacent to it take 5 poison damage. You can give the necroplasm the following special command.

While the summoned Necroplasm is present, each creature you hit with a basic or at-will attack takes 5 damage if it makes an attack before the end of its next turn, after it makes the attack.

Merkatroid:

Elliot:
We could just record everything we want to say and upload it to soundcloud
Merkatroid:
sounds good
:)
Elliot:
then all we'd have to do is listen to everyone's recordings, and record our own thing whenever we wanted to talk
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh ... that would be great.
in the mean time you could listen to this to get you in the mood.
or if you are Dave you aer probably allready listning to this.

Elliot:
Not really. We just stood around and thought about what to do
it's weird in this city. There's no crime, no abject poverty...
It's just like people living together
Narada:
Dirty pinkos.
GameMaster (GM):
City is not really the right word.
Elliot:

Elliot:

oh I wanted to ask, when they said people go out to get produce and supplies and whatnot... Is there like... a road? Or do they have to send expeditions through the jungle?
GameMaster (GM):
They go by boat.
Elliot:
oooohhhh
GameMaster (GM):
this river leads right to the Capitol.
Shit I meant to scan the map.
Elliot:
So that other option for getting here, coming up the river, we would have found their supply boats
Jak:
That was the "easy but long" route
Elliot:
right right
Merkatroid:
is there a lot of cat litter?
in the city?
GameMaster (GM):
heh heh heh
Elliot:
it's built on sand
it IS cat litter
GameMaster (GM):
gross
Elliot:
oh man
I bet that's what the buildings are made of!
GameMaster (GM):
That's racist. Would you go into a human church and say it's made of poo?
Jak:
Depends on the church. And the local building supplies...
GameMaster (GM):
Too much time in the Syllwode.
Elliot:
Pretty sure that's what Elliott says whenever he walks into any church
GameMaster (GM):
HAHAHAHAHAH!!!
I watched this film on the flix the other day. Silence. It was very religious.

So, we're waiting about half an hour for them to get here?

it was a strange week. went by fast but I'm still exausted.

Jak:
Well, my plan will be to talk Daemon's ear off. Either persude, put them to sleep, or seduce.
GameMaster (GM):
I would suspect and hope another session might be comming soon.
Jak:
Because, for some reason, I am far more successful at that than my normal attacks.

heh heh it is strange that Jak's talking plans seam to work more than his attacks.
Arwen:
I would like that...it was really fun
Jak:
Shadowrun is the cyberpunk take yeah? And yes, it is strange, as his charisma is not as good as his strength.

Shadowrun is Cyberpunk ... but with magic also.

It's too bad. I really like these characters. I would play Virgil every week if we had the chance. He has so much story to tell.

Because I'm probably gonna have to move in a couple of months anyways as a result.

GameMaster (GM):
fingers crossed for ya bud. If you need me to run any errands in H-fax for ya ... uh ... I'll see what I can do.
Jak:
It's gonna all be online applications. If I get a lead in Halifax, then I gotta look at places to stay.
GameMaster (GM):
right ... well you are in luck there are a shit tonne of new apartments and stuff going up as we speak.
Jak:
Someone was telling me about the poverty line in Halifax the other day. It's something like $19/hour with full time work.
That's the scarey part to me.
GameMaster (GM):
cheeper if you live off the peninsula.
It is much more expencive to live in Halifax propper.
Jak:
Yeah. One of the leads I've gotten already was for near Bayers Lake, though it was apparently an old lead. I was thinking it might be good for the apartment expenses alone.
GameMaster (GM):
Much cheaper out there.
Merkatroid:

GameMaster (GM):
ghad dam that was fast Jay.
I hear you .... it want me to download ... just a sec.
Merkatroid:
yeah it can run in the browser
or as a client
in the browser only supports push to talk
if you have the tab open and in focus
so they recommend the client
GameMaster (GM):
It's installing.
I thought it said I couln't set up push to talk in the browser,.
Merkatroid:
it can
GameMaster (GM):
almost there.
Merkatroid:
but you would have to have that tab in focus all the time
basically it can only listen for key push events when it's in the foreground
while a client can just hijack all the key presses
GameMaster (GM):

Hey, so how does this Discord thingy work?
Elliot:
click on the IX group tab
Merkatroid:
you set a push to talk button
then it's the same as mumble
GameMaster (GM):
You go t to click on the voice channel The IX Server.
Merkatroid:
and join the "The IX Server" channel on the left hand side
Attila:
So open up Discord, click on IX and set up a push to talk button?
GameMaster (GM):
yup
you all have badges
Attila:
For those of us more technically literate than me, how do I set it up?
Elliot:
good one
Attila:
Do I want two factor authentication?
GameMaster (GM):
The little gear icon in the bottom left.
Merkatroid:
you don't need 2 factor unless you want it
GameMaster (GM):
I don't think so.
No need unless you are worried about a hack.
Attila:
I don't even know what it is, so...yes?
GameMaster (GM):
it's just extra security.
Merkatroid:
you don't need it dave
Attila:
Let's pretend I barely know how to use a computer. Actually, let's not pretend...
Jak:
It means in addition to a password, you'd have to put in something extra, like a passcode sent to your email.
GameMaster (GM):
rectal scan
Merkatroid:
in the bottom left there's your username, some mic icons and a gear icon (options)
Jak:
So, if you are confident in your password, just stick with no 2 factor authentication.
Merkatroid:
-1
click that and go to the push to talk stuffs
Attila:
I clicked on that button and am at the push to talk section. Looking at everything I think I just got an anurism.
Merkatroid:
thats all ya need
then you can hop out
and click on the "voice channel" The IX Server
on the left hand menu
Jak:
Right under neith push to talk, there is a field to put in what keyboard button you want to use.
Ignore everything else.
GameMaster (GM):
maybe turn off the notification beep ... if you are not using headphones.
Attila:
I'm still stuck on "click on push to talk"
Elliot:
you need the desktop app to make a keystroke PTT
Attila:
I went to video & voice then went to push to talk.
I have it.
So I clicked on push to talk...
Jak:
Yes
Attila:
No what?
*now
Merkatroid:
you pick the key you want to use
Jak:
Right below it is a field that shays "Shortcut", right?
Attila:
^ Yeah, then when I clicked on it, it started to record.
I don't want to be recorded.
Merkatroid:
it's not recording
Jak:
So that's where you put your keyboard key. You should be able to click it again to turn off keybord recording
Merkatroid:
it's just waiting for you to press a button
GameMaster (GM):
it wants to record the button you want to use.
Attila:
Oh.
GameMaster (GM):
but cover up your web cam just to be safe.
Attila:
It's already covered.
Merkatroid:

Jak:
I just don't have a webcam
Attila:
So for voice input and output they say default. Will that pick up my headset?
Merkatroid:
depends what your defaults are
Jak:
Yes, it should
Attila:
@Merkatroid, I honestly have no Earthly clue what my defaults are or how to change it.
Merkatroid:
then just get out of that screen by hitting esc
or the X in the top right
and go click on the IX voice channel
Attila:

Khashana:

first question:
"Would her return to the Feywild be harmful to the Eladrin people/the Feywild in general."
Maybe also "Is she capable of restoring some of the damage she is responsible for/ is she likely to hurt people again?/is she likely to seriously injure or kill again?"
And maybe lastly "Will we ruin our positive reputation by rescuing her? Like Be kicked out of a kingdom/town level of ruining rep?"
1st:
Would her return to be harmful to the Eladrin people or the the Feywild?
Jak:
2nd:
Is she likely to seriously injure or kill again?
3rd:
Where is she located? (Have a map pre-laid-out
Elliot:
maybe rephrase 1 to "inhabitants of the Feywild'?

Arwen:
Range:
Close Burst 5
Target:
One creature in burst
Effect:
You mark a target, which remains marked until you mark another target or if you fail to engage the creature. New marks supersede this one.
While marked, the creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you. Also, it takes +5 radiant damage the first time it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target before the start of your next turn.
Arwen:
On your turn, you must engage the target or challenge a different target. To engage, you must either attack it or end your turn adjacent to it. If not, the marked condition ends and you can't use it on your next turn.
Special:
This doesn't rely on intelligence or language comprehension of the target.
